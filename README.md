# Tic Tac Toe
## Usage
This is a in-browser Tic Tac Toe game. The rules, if you've never heard them before, are simple:

- Players take turns picking empty boxes to "claim"
- If either player gets 3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then the game ends with that player as the winner
- If the board is filled up and neither player has won, then its a tie
